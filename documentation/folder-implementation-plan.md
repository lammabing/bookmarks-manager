# Folder Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for implementing a hierarchical folder/collection system for organizing bookmarks. The system will support nested folders, drag-and-drop functionality, and seamless integration with the existing tag-based organization.

This implementation aims to enhance bookmark organization by:
1. Providing a familiar hierarchical structure similar to browser bookmarks
2. Enabling import/export compatibility with browser bookmark systems
3. Supporting both folder-based and tag-based organization simultaneously
4. Facilitating easy reorganization through drag-and-drop functionality

## System Architecture

### Data Model Design

The folder system will use a tree structure with the following components:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Root Folder] --> B[Work]
    A --> C[Personal]
    A --> D[Learning]
    B --> E[Projects]
    B --> F[Resources]
    C --> G[Entertainment]
    C --> H[Shopping]
    E --> I[Project Alpha]
    E --> J[Project Beta]
```

### Database Schema

#### Folder Model
```javascript
const folderSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { 
    type: String, 
    required: true,
    trim: true,
    maxlength: 100
  },
  description: { 
    type: String,
    trim: true,
    maxlength: 500
  },
  parent: { 
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
    ref: 'Folder',
    default: null 
  },
  owner: { 
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
    ref: 'User',
    required: true 
  },
  isRoot: { 
    type: Boolean, 
    default: false 
  },
  order: { 
    type: Number, 
    default: 0 
  },
  color: { 
    type: String, 
    default: '#3B82F6',
    match: /^#([A-Fa-f0-9]{6}|[A-Fa-f0-9]{3})$/
  },
  icon: { 
    type: String, 
    default: 'folder',
    maxlength: 50
  },
  bookmarkCount: {
    type: Number,
    default: 0
  },
  createdAt: { 
    type: Date, 
    default: Date.now 
  },
  updatedAt: { 
    type: Date, 
    default: Date.now 
  }
});
```

#### Bookmark Model Updates
```javascript
// Add folder reference to existing bookmark schema
folder: { 
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
  ref: 'Folder',
  default: null 
}
