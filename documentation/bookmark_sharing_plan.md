# Bookmark Sharing Feature Implementation Plan

## Database Model Updates
- **Bookmark.js**:
  ```javascript
  visibility: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['private', 'public', 'selected'],
    default: 'private'
  },
  sharedWith: [{
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User'
  }]
  ```

## API Endpoints
1. `PUT /bookmarks/:id/share` - Update sharing settings
2. `GET /users/shareable` - List shareable users
3. `POST /notifications` - Send sharing notifications

## Frontend Components
1. **ShareSettings.jsx** - Visibility selector and user picker
2. **UserSelector.jsx** - Searchable user selection component
3. **SharingBadge.jsx** - Visual indicators for sharing status

## Security Measures
- Ownership verification middleware
- Rate limiting on share operations
- Audit logging for sharing actions

## Performance Optimization
- Database indexing on `visibility` and `sharedWith`
- Pagination for shared bookmarks
- Virtual scrolling in user selector

## UI/UX Recommendations
- Visibility badges: ðŸ”’ (private), ðŸŒŽ (public), ðŸ‘¥ (selected)
- Toast notifications for share actions
- "Shared with me" filter option
- Undo functionality for share operations

## Implementation Sequence
1. Update Bookmark model
2. Implement backend sharing endpoints
3. Create frontend ShareSettings component
4. Integrate sharing UI into Add/Edit Bookmark forms
5. Add sharing indicators to BookmarkGrid
6. Implement "Shared with me" filter
