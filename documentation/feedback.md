## Recent Issues Resolved âœ…

### Public Bookmarks Route Ordering (2025-01-27)
**Issue:** Public bookmarks endpoint returning "Cast to ObjectId failed for value 'public'" error

**Resolution:**
- Reordered routes in `routes/bookmarks.js` to place specific routes before parameterized routes
- Added enhanced error handling and debugging for public bookmarks endpoint
- Verified 10 public bookmarks are now displaying correctly on homepage
- Improved API error messages for better debugging
