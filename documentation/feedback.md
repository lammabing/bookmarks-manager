## Recent Issues Resolved âœ…

### Dashboard Rendering Issues (2025-01-27)
**Issue:** Dashboard showing blank screen after login with multiple console errors
**Root Causes:** 
- API endpoint mismatch (`/users/profile` vs `/users/me`)
- Missing `FolderSelector` and `TagSelector` components
- Undefined `fontSettings` causing crashes
- Duplicate tag displays in bookmark cards

**Resolution:**
- Fixed API endpoint in `src/utils/api.js` to use correct `/users/me` route
- Replaced missing selector components with basic HTML select elements
- Added proper font settings fallback and context integration
- Added view mode toggle (grid/list) functionality
- Removed duplicate tag displays, keeping only bottom row tags
- Improved error handling throughout Dashboard component

### Public Bookmarks Route Ordering (2025-01-27)
**Issue:** Public bookmarks endpoint returning "Cast to ObjectId failed for value 'public'" error
**Root Cause:** Express route ordering - parameterized `/:id` route was matching before specific `/public` route
**Resolution:**
- Reordered routes in `routes/bookmarks.js` to place specific routes before parameterized routes
- Added enhanced error handling and debugging for public bookmarks endpoint
- Verified 10 public bookmarks are now displaying correctly on homepage
- Improved API error messages for better debugging
