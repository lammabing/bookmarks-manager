### Planned Features for Bookmarking App

This document outlines potential features to add to the bookmarking application, aiming to improve its utility, usability, flexibility, and robustness. Each feature includes a brief description and notes on practicality and tradeoffs.

#### 1. Enhanced Tag Management [COMPLETED]

*   **Description:** Provide a dedicated interface to view all existing tags, see how many bookmarks are associated with each tag, and allow users to rename or delete tags globally.
*   **Practicality:** Relatively practical to implement. Requires backend endpoints for tag management and a frontend UI component.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Need to handle orphaned bookmarks if a tag is deleted. Renaming a tag affects all associated bookmarks.
*   **Status:** Completed. Backend APIs and frontend UI implemented.

#### 2. Folder/Collection System

*   **Description:** Implement a hierarchical structure (like folders or collections) to organize bookmarks in addition to or as an alternative to tags.
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires changes to the data model (adding a 'folder' or 'collection' field, potentially with nesting), backend API, and significant frontend UI/UX work for drag-and-drop or selection-based organization.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Adds complexity to data querying and display. Users might prefer one system (tags vs. folders) over the other, or find managing both cumbersome.

#### 3. Advanced Filtering and Sorting

*   **Description:** Expand search capabilities to include filtering by multiple tags, filtering by date ranges (added or updated), and provide more sorting options (alphabetical by title/URL, by date, by frequency of access - if tracked).
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires modifications to the backend API to support more complex queries and frontend UI elements for filter/sort controls.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Can increase query load on the database depending on implementation. UI can become cluttered with too many options.

#### 4. User Authentication and Sync

*   **Description:** Add user accounts to allow multiple users to use the application and sync bookmarks across different browsers or devices.
*   **Practicality:** High complexity. Requires implementing a full authentication system (user registration, login, sessions), securing API endpoints, and handling data synchronization logic.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Significant development effort and security considerations. Introduces the need for user management and potentially hosting infrastructure changes.

#### 5. Dedicated Browser Extension

*   **Description:** Develop browser extensions for popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to provide a more seamless way to add and access bookmarks directly from any webpage, potentially with context menus or toolbar popups.
*   **Practicality:** High complexity. Requires learning browser extension APIs for each target browser (though WebExtensions API helps standardize). Development and maintenance overhead for multiple browser platforms.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Requires separate development lifecycle from the main web app. Distribution through browser stores involves review processes.

#### 6. Rich Text Notes/Description

*   **Description:** Allow users to add formatted text (bold, italics, lists, links) or even images to the bookmark description or a dedicated notes field.
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires integrating a rich text editor component in the frontend and storing formatted content (e.g., HTML or Markdown) in the database.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Increases storage size for descriptions. Need to consider how formatted content is displayed consistently across different views.

#### 7. Dead Link Checking

*   **Description:** Implement a feature to periodically check if bookmarked URLs are still valid and notify the user if a link is broken.
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires a background process (server-side) to perform checks and a mechanism to display results to the user (e.g., marking broken links in the UI).
*   **Tradeoffs:** Can consume server resources and bandwidth depending on the number of bookmarks and check frequency. Need to handle rate limiting and potential blocking by websites.

#### 8. Bulk Editing and Deletion

*   **Description:** Allow users to select multiple bookmarks and perform actions like deleting them, adding/removing tags, or moving them to a folder in a single operation.
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires implementing multi-select functionality in the frontend UI and backend API endpoints for bulk operations.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Need to carefully design the UI to prevent accidental bulk actions.
#### 9. Smart Folders/Collections (Dynamic)

*   **Description:** Allow users to create collections that automatically populate based on defined criteria (e.g., tags, date added, domain). This builds upon the planned "Advanced Filtering and Sorting."
*   **Practicality:** Moderate to High complexity. Requires robust backend logic for dynamic querying and updating, and a clear UI for defining criteria.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Can be resource-intensive if not optimized. UI for defining complex rules might become complicated.

#### 10. Sharing Options

*   **Description:** Enable users to share individual bookmarks or collections (if implemented) via a unique link. If user accounts are added, sharing could be direct to other users.
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity if sharing publicly. High complexity if sharing with specific users (requires user accounts).
*   **Tradeoffs:** Public sharing needs careful consideration of privacy. User-specific sharing depends on the authentication system.

#### 11. Custom Fields

*   **Description:** Allow users to define and add their own custom data fields to bookmarks (e.g., "priority," "project," "status," "rating").
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires changes to the data model to support flexible schemas and UI for managing custom fields.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Can make data querying more complex. UI for managing and displaying custom fields needs to be intuitive.

#### 12. Public API for Third-Party Integrations

*   **Description:** Develop a secure API that allows other applications or services to interact with a user's bookmarks (e.g., for backup, integration with other productivity tools). This would likely require the "User Authentication" feature.
*   **Practicality:** High complexity. Requires robust API design, security (authentication, rate limiting), and documentation.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Significant development and maintenance effort. Security is paramount.

#### 13. Website Previews/Thumbnails

*   **Description:** Automatically fetch and display a small screenshot or preview image of the bookmarked webpage.
*   **Practicality:** Moderate to High complexity. Requires a service or library for generating screenshots (can be client-side or server-side). Storage for images needs to be considered.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Can be resource-intensive (bandwidth, processing for screenshot generation, storage). Reliability of screenshot generation can vary.

#### 14. Content Archiving (Snapshot)

*   **Description:** Optionally save a simplified HTML or PDF snapshot of the bookmarked page's content. This complements the planned "Dead Link Checking."
*   **Practicality:** High complexity. Requires robust content fetching, sanitization, and conversion to a stable format (HTML/PDF). Significant storage implications.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Can consume considerable server resources and storage. Accuracy of snapshots for complex pages can be challenging.

#### 15. Usage Statistics/Analytics

*   **Description:** Provide users with insights into their bookmarking habits (e.g., most frequently accessed bookmarks, most used tags, number of bookmarks added over time).
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires tracking user interactions and aggregating data. UI for displaying stats.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Privacy considerations for tracked data. Can add load to the database for logging and querying.

#### 16. Related Bookmarks Suggestions

*   **Description:** When viewing or adding a bookmark, suggest other similar or related bookmarks from their existing collection based on tags, title keywords, or domain.
*   **Practicality:** Moderate to High complexity. Requires implementing a recommendation algorithm (can range from simple keyword matching to more advanced techniques).
*   **Tradeoffs:** Quality of suggestions depends on the algorithm's sophistication. Can be computationally intensive.

#### 17. Customizable Dashboard/Homepage

*   **Description:** Allow users to personalize their main view with widgets (e.g., "Recently Added," "Most Visited," "Favorite Tags," specific collections).
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires a flexible dashboard layout system and individual widget components.
*   **Tradeoffs:** UI complexity for customization. Performance implications if many widgets are active.

#### 18. Enhanced Theming and Appearance

*   **Description:** Expand beyond the current font settings to offer more comprehensive theming options (e.g., multiple light/dark themes, accent colors, layout density).
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires well-structured CSS and JavaScript for theme switching.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Time-consuming to design and implement multiple themes. Ensuring consistency across all components.

#### 19. Guided Tour & Onboarding for New Features

*   **Description:** For new users, and when significant new features are released, provide a brief interactive tour highlighting functionality and benefits.
*   **Practicality:** Low to Moderate complexity. Several libraries exist for creating guided tours.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Content for tours needs to be maintained as the app evolves. Can be annoying if not implemented thoughtfully.

#### 20. Comprehensive Keyboard Shortcuts

*   **Description:** Implement a full suite of keyboard shortcuts for common actions (e.g., add bookmark, search, navigate views, open next/previous bookmark).
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires careful mapping of shortcuts and handling potential conflicts.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Discoverability of shortcuts. Ensuring they don't conflict with browser or OS shortcuts.

#### 21. Activity Feed/Changelog

*   **Description:** A section where users can see recent activity (e.g., "Bookmark X added," "Tag Y created," "Link Z found broken").
*   **Practicality:** Moderate complexity. Requires logging relevant actions and a UI to display the feed.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Can increase database writes. UI needs to be designed to be informative but not overwhelming.
